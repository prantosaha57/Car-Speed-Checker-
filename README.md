# Car-Speed-Checker-
The "Speed Checker" project uses Arduino Uno and IR sensors to measure the speed of moving objects, such as toy cars. The system calculates speed and displays it on an LCD screen while alerting users with a buzzer for overspeed. This project highlights its application in monitoring and controlling speed near restricted areas.
